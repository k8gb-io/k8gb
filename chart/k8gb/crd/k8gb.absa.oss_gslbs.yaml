                                      pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can
                                      be one of the following values:
                                      * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
                                      * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
                                        done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
                                        list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
                                        match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
                                        request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
                                        of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
                                        matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
                                      * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
                                        the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
                                        or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
                                      Implementations are required to support all path types.
