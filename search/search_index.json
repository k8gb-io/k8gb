Increase the number of DNS servers: Add more DNS servers to the list <code>.Values.k8gb.edgeDNSServers</code> in your <code>values.yaml</code>. k8gb will choose one DNS server at random (round-robin) for each reconciliation, distributing the load.</p> <p>2. Increase the reconciliation interval Raise the value of <code>.Values.k8gb.reconcileRequeueSeconds</code> in your <code>values.yaml</code>.

Provided that the comm client is also instrumented with OpenTracing bits one doesn't have to call the <code>Extract</code> and  <code>Inject</code> on his own.
