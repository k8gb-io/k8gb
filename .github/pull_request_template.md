  ### Debug tests
  If the test suite is failing for you, you may want to try triggering `Re-run all jobs` (top right) with [debug logging](https://docs.github.com/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging) enabled. This will also add make the [print debug](/k8gb-io/k8gb/blob/master/.github/actions/print-debug/action.yaml) action more verbose.
