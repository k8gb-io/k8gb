/* Adapters for Gateway API resources
This file contains adapters for Gateway API resources.
We need to fetch the ParentRefs and BackendRefs fields. However, different Gateway API resources exposed different types for their spec fields
RouteAdapter and RouteRule interfaces are used to provide a common interface for the different Gateway API resources.
