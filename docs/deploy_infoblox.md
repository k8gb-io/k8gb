# General deployment with Infoblox integration

## Prologue

For simplicity let's assume that you operate two geographically distributed clusters you want to enable global load-balancing for. In this example, two local clusters will represent those two distributed clusters.

* Let's switch the context to the first cluster
```sh
export KUBECONFIG=eu-cluster
```

* Copy the default `values.yaml` from k8gb chart to any convenient location, e.g.
```sh
cp chart/k8gb/values.yaml ~/k8gb/eu-cluster.yaml
```

* Modify the example configuration. Important parameters described below:
  * `dnsZone` - this zone will be delegated to the `edgeDNS` in your environment. E.g. `yourzone.edgedns.com`
  * `edgeDNSZone` - this zone will be automatically configured by k8gb to delegate to `dnsZone` and will make k8gb controlled nodes act as authoritative server for this zone. E.g. `edgedns.com`
  * `edgeDNSServers` stable DNS servers in your environment that is controlled by edgeDNS provider e.g. Infoblox so k8gb instances will be able to talk to each other through automatically created DNS names
  * `clusterGeoTag` to geographically tag your cluster. We are operating `eu` cluster in this example
  * `extGslbClustersGeoTags` contains Geo tag of the cluster(s) to talk with when k8gb is deployed to multiple clusters. Imagine your second cluster is `us` so we tag it accordingly
  * `infoblox.enabled: true` to enable automated zone delegation configuration at edgeDNS provider. You don't need it for local testing and can optionally be skipped. Meanwhile, in this section we will cover a fully operational end-to-end scenario.
The other parameters do not need to be modified unless you want to do something special. E.g. to use images from private registry

  * Export Infoblox related information in the shell.
```sh
export WAPI_USERNAME=<WAPI_USERNAME>
export WAPI_PASSWORD=<WAPI_PASSWORD>
```

* Create the Infoblox secret which is used by k8gb to configure edgeDNS by running:
```sh
kubectl create ns k8gb
make infoblox-secret
```

* Expose associated k8gb CoreDNS service for DNS traffic on worker nodes.
  > Check [this document](./exposing_dns.md) for detailed information.

* Let's deploy k8gb to the first cluster. Most of the helper commands are abstracted by GNU `make`. If you want to look under the hood please check the `Makefile`. In general, standard Kubernetes/Helm commands are used. Point deployment mechanism to your custom `values.yaml`
```sh
make deploy-gslb-operator VALUES_YAML=~/k8gb/eu-cluster.yaml
```

* It should deploy k8gb pretty quickly. Let's check the pod status
```sh
 kubectl -n k8gb get pod
NAME                                                       READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
k8gb-76cc56b55-t779s                                       1/1     Running    0          39s
k8gb-coredns-799984c646-qz88m                              1/1     Running    0          41s
```

* Deploy k8gb to the second cluster by repeating the same steps with the exception of:
  * Switch context to 2nd cluster with `export KUBECONFIG=us-cluster`
  * Create another custom `values.yaml` with `cp ~/k8gb/eu-cluster.yaml ~/k8gb/us-cluster.yaml`
  * Create another geo tag to enable cross cluster communication:
    * `clusterGeoTag` becomes `us`
    * `extGslbClustersGeoTags` becomes `eu`
  * Run the installation pointing to new values file `make deploy-gslb-operator VALUES_YAML=~/k8gb/us-cluster.yaml`

* When your 2nd cluster is ready by checking with `kubectl -n k8gb get pod`, we can proceed with the sample application installation

* We will use well known testing community app of [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo)
```sh
helm repo add podinfo https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo
kubectl create ns test-gslb
helm upgrade --install podinfo --namespace test-gslb --set ui.message="us" podinfo/podinfo
```
As you can see above we did set special geo tag message in podinfo configuration matching cluster geo tag. It is just for demonstration purposes.

* Check that podinfo is running
```sh
kubectl -n test-gslb get pod
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
podinfo-5cfcdc9c45-jbg96   1/1     Running   0          2m18s
```

* Let's create Gslb CRD to enable global load balancing for this application. Notice the podinfo Service name
```sh
kubectl -n test-gslb get svc
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
podinfo         ClusterIP   10.96.250.84    <none>        9898/TCP,9999/TCP   9m39s
```

* Create a custom resource `~/k8gb/podinfogslb.yaml` describing `Gslb` as per the sample below:
```yaml
apiVersion: k8gb.absa.oss/v1beta1
kind: Gslb
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: test-gslb
spec:
  ingress:
    rules:
      - host: podinfo.cloud.example.com
        http:
          paths:
          - backend:
              serviceName: podinfo # This should point to Service name of testing application
              servicePort: http
            path: /
  strategy:
    type: roundRobin # Use a round robin load balancing strategy, when deciding which downstream clusters to route clients too
```

* And apply the resource in the target app namespace
```sh
kubectl -n test-gslb apply -f podinfogslb.yaml
gslb.k8gb.absa.oss/podinfo created
```

* Check Gslb resource
```sh
kubectl -n test-gslb get gslb
NAME      AGE
podinfo   39s
```

* Check Gslb resource status
```sh
kubectl -n test-gslb describe gslb
Name:         podinfo
Namespace:    test-gslb
Labels:       <none>

      172.17.0.8
  Service Health:
    podinfo.cloud.example.com:  Healthy
Events:                         <none>
```

* In the output above you should see that Gslb detected the `Healthy` status of underlying `podinfo` standard Kubernetes Service

* Check that internal k8gb DNS servers are responding accordingly on this cluster
  * Pick one of the worker nodes to test with
    ```sh
    k get nodes -o wide
    NAME                       STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE       KERNEL-VERSION     CONTAINER-RUNTIME
    test-gslb2-control-plane   Ready    master   53m   v1.17.0   172.17.0.9    <none>        Ubuntu 19.10   4.19.76-linuxkit   containerd://1.3.2
    test-gslb2-worker          Ready    <none>   52m   v1.17.0   172.17.0.8    <none>        Ubuntu 19.10   4.19.76-linuxkit   containerd://1.3.2
    test-gslb2-worker2         Ready    <none>   52m   v1.17.0   172.17.0.7    <none>        Ubuntu 19.10   4.19.76-linuxkit   containerd://1.3.2

    ```
  * Use `dig` to make a DNS query to it
    ```sh
    dig +short @172.17.0.10 podinfo.cloud.example.com
    172.17.0.8
    172.17.0.10
    172.17.0.7
    ```
  * One of your workers should already return DNS responses constructed by Gslb based on service health information
  * If edgeDNS was configured you can query your standard infra DNS directly and it should return the same
    ```sh
    dig +short podinfo.cloud.example.com
    172.17.0.8
    172.17.0.10
    172.17.0.7
    ```
* Now it's time to deploy this application to the first `eu` cluster. The steps and configuration are exactly the same. Just changing `ui.message` to `eu`
```sh
kubectl create ns test-gslb
helm upgrade --install podinfo --namespace test-gslb --set ui.message="eu" podinfo/podinfo
```

* Apply exactly the same Gslb definition
```sh
kubectl -n test-gslb apply -f podinfogslb.yaml
```

* Check the Gslb resource status.
```sh
k -n test-gslb describe gslb podinfo
Name:         podinfo
Namespace:    test-gslb
Labels:       <none>

    Rules:
      Host:  podinfo.cloud.example.com
      Http:
        Paths:
          Backend:
            Service Name:  podinfo
            Service Port:  http
          Path:            /
  Strategy:
    Type:  roundRobin
Status:
  Geo Tag:  eu
  Healthy Records:
    podinfo.cloud.example.com:
      172.17.0.3
      172.17.0.5
      172.17.0.6
      172.17.0.8
      172.17.0.10
      172.17.0.7
  Service Health:
    podinfo.cloud.example.com:  Healthy
Events:                         <none>
```

* Ideally you should already see that `Healthy Records` of `podinfo.cloud.example.com` return the records from __both__ of the clusters. Otherwise, give it a couple of minutes to sync up.

* Now you can check the DNS responses the same way as before.
```sh
dig +short podinfo.cloud.example.com
172.17.0.8
172.17.0.5
172.17.0.10
172.17.0.7
172.17.0.6
172.17.0.3
```

* And for the final end-to-end test, we can use `curl` to query the application
```sh
curl -s podinfo.example.com|grep message
  "message": "eu",

curl -s podinfo.example.com|grep message
  "message": "us",

curl -s podinfo.example.com|grep message
  "message": "us",

curl -s podinfo.example.com||grep message
  "message": "eu",
```

* As you can see specially marked `podinfo` returns different geo tags showing us the Global Round Robin strategy is working as expected

Hope you enjoyed the ride!
